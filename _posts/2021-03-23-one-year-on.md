On 23rd March 2020, [the UK entered a national lockdown](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-23-march-2020) in an attempt to curb the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its population. Shops were closed, time spent outside was strictly limited, social contact beyond our households was eliminated completely, and working from home became the new normal for millions. In the run up to what ended up being the first lockdown of three (so far), many of us were already taking precautions to keep ourselves and others safe. I went to visit my parents for the weekend of the 14th and 15th March, getting a train down to Hertfordshire on Friday 13th (a bad omen if ever there was one). That day I'd been in the office 'working' (read: chatting) with a few of my friends before getting the tram to the train station. Half-jokingly, I suggested we hug in case it would be the last time we could for a while. I still haven't hugged those friends again yet.

I returned to Nottingham on 16th March in the midst of the [stockpiling crisis in UK supermarkets](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-uk-panic-buyers-urged-to-think-of-frontline-workers) which forced me to also stock up on 'essentials' such as toilet roll, chopped tomatoes and chickpeas. That day I also decided it was time to make the move to working from home, as it was becoming apparent that the situation in the UK was taking a turn for the worse. I lugged my computer monitor and stationery to the bus stop so I could set up a sufficient workspace at home. At the time, I certainly wasn't aware that those items would still be in my flat one year on, with no plan for returning to the office any time soon.

Honestly, I found the transition from office to home working incredibly difficult. I live alone, so the social isolation was particularly difficult for me. [Support bubbles weren't introduced until June](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53031844), so I went a full three months without touching another human being. [In-person social interaction is fundamental](https://theconversation.com/why-our-screens-leave-us-hungry-for-more-nutritious-forms-of-social-interaction-142019) to maintain health and wellbeing, so it was like some sort of torture having to go so long without social contact. My mental health declined rapidly, and I found myself developing agoraphobia - I simply didn't feel safe outside the confines of my flat. I had to rely heavily on my friends to buy my food and collect prescriptions for me. I don't know what I'd have done without them and I will forever be grateful for their generosity and kindness.

Had I been employed, I would have been [entitled to take sick leave](https://www.gov.uk/taking-sick-leave) from work, but as a postgraduate reseacher (PGR), I am not entitled to any of these rights. My only options were to suspend my studies and take time off without any income, or to carry on and lose even more time to poor health. Of course, taking unpaid leave was never an option for me - how would I afford rent and bills without an income? - so I had to power through, returning to work through the sheer pressure of the financial difficulties I would face otherwise. My personal circumstances aside, other PGRs have experienced a wide range of negative impacts from the coronavirus crisis, including cancelled fieldwork, postponed laboratory work, and time lost due to personal circumstances, childcare, and health issues.

Currently, funding extensions are not available to PhD students who just cite 'time lost' as the reason they are behind. Pandemic PGRs, a network of PGRs in the UK, have produced a [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-6sBsboTyQ820axeJIFd8S4a2AOgSS5K/view?fbclid=IwAR1cV_1So08KuaFx-Pl3NAeR5ClLWABZgfvOoddgc29m-KTvPa33ii6W2vk) outlining the failings in funding support they have (or have not) received. PhD students now have an expectation on them to produce research of equal quality to that which they would have produced during 'normal' times, which is wholly unfair if funding extensions are not available to everyone. The University and College Union (UCU) are now campaigning to [get PGRs recognised as members of staff](https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/11206/PGRs-as-staff-not-students?list=7268) so they can benefit from better pay and employment rights for which they currently do not qualify. I fully support this campaign - the academic world needs to let go of the "I had to suffer so you should too" rhetoric, and start paving the way for a better future for those just starting out in their academic careers.

Now that we're in March 2021, I have found myself reflecting on this past year. What have I learnt about myself? What have I learnt about others? Would I have done anything different if I could go back a year? 

Only since the start of 2021 have I truly settled into a rhythm of working from home. I now have a routine to my weekdays to which I loosely stick, although I am so far from a morning person I must admit that I've struggled to get going some mornings. But that's okay. Why the pressure? We're in a PANDEMIC. If you need an extra hour or two in bed, then enjoy it. Need an extra snack? Eat it! 


My working from home tips for professional procrastinators
------
1. **Try to get up at the same time everyday.** I usually get up around 8:30 (not too early but early enough to still have a productive morning)

2. **Start your day with something you love.** I listen to a podcast with breakfast and then tend to my houseplants before getting myself ready for the day.

3. **Have a dedicated workspace in your home.** If you're lucky enough to have a study in your home, then make sure you use it and close the door when you're not working. If, like me, you have limited space, set up a table or desk in the corner of a room (ideally with lots of natural light) that you only use for work. NEVER sit there when you're not working. This will help you get into the working mindset, so as soon as you sit down, your work brain will kick in, and when you're done for the day, you can leave your work at the desk ready for the next day.

4. **Write a list of tasks you want to achieve that day, and do the quickest one first.** You'll feel great about ticking something off your list quickly.

5. **Schedule a proper lunch break.** If you don't, you might find yourself eating at funny times or accidentally skipping meals altogether. A happy tummy makes for a happy mind.

6. **Try and set up a co-working group with colleagues or friends.** My friends and I join a video call on Microsoft Teams everyday and use the Pomodoro method to structure our days. We usually do 40 minutes of work with cameras and microphones turned off, followed by a 5-minute break where we have a quick chat, then another 40 minutes of work, and so on. This has MASSIVELY helped my procrastination as I am now accountable for my work and it gives a bit of social interaction that is often missing while working from home.

7. **Finish your working day before you have dinner.** This way, you'll have the whole evening to do things that you love and that help you to relax. There's nothing worse than working instead of switching off because you didn't set a boundary for yourself.
