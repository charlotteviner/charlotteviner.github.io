I was a demonstrator for the 2nd year undergraduate module *River Processes and Dynamics* which introduces the students to water and sediment processes that operate in rivers, linking river processes with channel dynamics.

In my role as demonstrator, I was responsible for running laboratory flume practicals to demonstrate:
* The hydraulics of open channel flow (laminar vs. turbulent flow, viscous sublayer)
* The initiation of sediment transport (threshold of incipient motion)
* The sequence of bedforms typically seen in sand-bed rivers as flow progresses from lower to upper regimes (ripples, dunes, plane bed, antidunes)
