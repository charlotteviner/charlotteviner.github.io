I am currently a teaching affiliate for the 1st year undergraduate module *Introduction to GIS*. In this module, the students are introduced to the concepts and practices of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for spatial thinking and simple GIS-based problem solving. In addition to learning the theoretical principles underpinning GIS, the students also learn the basics of applied GIS analysis using ArcGIS Online through a series of practical tasks, including proximity analysis, spatial analysis, and visualisation techniques. This year, the module is being delivered 100% online through a series of lecture engagement sessions and drop-in classes, hosted on Microsoft Teams, to support the students' learning.

In my role as TA, I am responsible for:
* Providing assistance and advice to students with the ArcGIS Online practical tasks 
* Marking and giving feedback to the students for their coursework
