I am currently a teaching affiliate for the 1st year undergraduate module *Introduction to GIS*. In this module, the students are introduced to ArcGIS Online, learning the uses and basic principles of working within a GIS for spatial analysis and visualisation. I am responsible for providing assistance and advice to students as part of the practical element of the module, and I will be marking and giving feedback to the students for their coursework. This year, the module is being delivered 100% online.
